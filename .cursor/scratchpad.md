# Vocalytics Insight - Theme Implementation Plan

## Background and Motivation

The user wants to enhance the UI with a more interactive dark and light theme system with user-readable format. The current application already has:
- A basic dark/light theme setup in CSS with HSL color variables
- Tailwind CSS configured with dark mode support
- A vibrant color palette with purple, blue, pink, and yellow accents
- Basic UI components using shadcn/ui

The goal is to make the theme switching more interactive and user-friendly while maintaining the existing design aesthetic.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

1. **Current State**: The app has dark mode CSS variables but no interactive theme switching mechanism
2. **User Experience**: Need to add a theme toggle that's easily accessible and visually appealing
3. **Persistence**: Theme preference should be saved and restored on page reload
4. **Accessibility**: Theme switching should be smooth and accessible
5. **Consistency**: All components should properly respond to theme changes
